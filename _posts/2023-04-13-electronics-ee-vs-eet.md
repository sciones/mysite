**Understanding the Differences**

Electrical Engineering (EE) and Electronics Engineering Technology (EET) are two related fields that are often confused with each other. While there is some overlap between the two, there are also some key differences that distinguish them. In this post, we'll explore these differences in detail and help you determine which field may be the best fit for you.

**Electrical Engineering**

Electrical Engineering is a broad field of engineering that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It focuses on the design and development of electrical systems and components, such as power generation and distribution systems, electric motors, and control systems. EE degree programs typically include coursework in mathematics, physics, and computer science, as well as courses in electrical circuits, electronic devices and systems, and signal processing.

One of the primary differences between EE and EET is the level of theory and conceptual design involved. EE programs tend to be more theoretical and design-oriented, with a focus on developing new concepts and theories to solve complex problems. Graduates of EE programs are typically equipped with the skills and knowledge to work in a variety of industries, such as power systems, telecommunications, and robotics.

**Electronics Engineering Technology**

Electronics Engineering Technology is a subfield of engineering technology that focuses specifically on the practical application of electronics principles to design and develop electronic systems and components. EET degree programs typically cover topics such as circuit analysis, digital electronics, microprocessors, and computer programming. EET graduates are typically involved in the design, installation, and maintenance of electronic systems and equipment in a variety of industries, such as telecommunications, manufacturing, and aerospace.

One of the primary differences between EET and EE is the focus on practical applications. EET programs tend to be more hands-on and practical, with a focus on developing the skills and knowledge necessary to work in a technical capacity. Graduates of EET programs are typically employed in fields such as electronics manufacturing, testing and repair, and technical support.

Another difference between the two fields is the level of math and science required. EE programs typically require more advanced mathematics, such as calculus and differential equations, as well as more in-depth physics courses. EET programs, while still requiring a strong foundation in math and science, tend to focus more on practical applications of these subjects.

**Job Prospects and Salary**

Both Electrical Engineering and Electronics Engineering Technology degrees can lead to rewarding careers in engineering and technology. However, the specific career prospects and salaries may differ based on the chosen field of study. EE graduates typically go on to work in industries such as power systems, telecommunications, and robotics, while EET graduates are typically employed in fields such as electronics manufacturing, testing and repair, and technical support.

In terms of salary, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual salary for electrical and electronics engineers was $103,390 in May 2020. However, this can vary significantly based on factors such as industry, location, and experience.

**Conclusion**

In summary, while Electrical Engineering and Electronics Engineering Technology degrees share some commonalities, there are some key differences between the two in terms of focus, coursework, and career prospects. EE programs tend to focus more on theory and conceptual design, while EET programs are more hands-on and practical, with a focus on real-world applications. Both degrees can lead to rewarding careers in engineering and technology, but the path to get there may differ based on the chosen field of study. Ultimately, the decision between an EE and EET degree should be based on your interests, skills, and career goals.
