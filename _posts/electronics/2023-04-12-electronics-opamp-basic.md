An operational amplifier (op-amp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically 100,000 times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals. The operational amplifier traces its origin and name to analog computers, where they were used to perform mathematical operations in linear, non-linear, and frequency-dependent circuits.

Op-amps are packaged as components or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits. The op-amp is one type of differential amplifier. Other types of differential amplifier include the fully differential amplifier (an op-amp with a differential rather than single-ended output), the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op amps), the isolation amplifier (with galvanic isolation between input and output), and negative-feedback amplifier (usually built from one or more op amps and a resistive feedback network).

Op-amps are widely used in analog electronics, with applications in signal processing, control systems, and instrumentation. They are also used in many digital circuits, such as A/D converters and D/A converters.

**Basic Operation**

An op-amp is a two-port device, with an input port and an output port. The input port consists of two terminals, called the inverting input and the non-inverting input. The output port consists of a single terminal.

The inverting input is usually marked with a minus sign (-), and the non-inverting input is usually marked with a plus sign (+). The output voltage is usually denoted as Vout.

The ideal op-amp has the following characteristics:

* Infinite gain: The output voltage is always infinite times larger than the input voltage.
* Infinite input impedance: The input current is always zero.
* Zero output impedance: The output voltage is always zero volts.
* Infinite bandwidth: The op-amp can amplify signals of any frequency.

In reality, op-amps do not have these ideal characteristics. However, they are very close to ideal, and they can be used to perform a wide variety of operations.

**Applications**

Op-amps are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* Amplifiers: Op-amps can be used to amplify signals, both voltage and current.
* Comparators: Op-amps can be used to compare two signals and output a voltage that indicates which signal is larger.
* Integrators: Op-amps can be used to integrate signals, which is useful for creating filters and other circuits that respond to the time-domain properties of a signal.
* Differentiators: Op-amps can be used to differentiate signals, which is useful for creating filters and other circuits that respond to the frequency-domain properties of a signal.
* Oscillators: Op-amps can be used to create oscillators, which are circuits that generate periodic signals.
* Multipliers: Op-amps can be used to multiply two signals, which is useful for creating circuits that perform mathematical operations.
* Adders: Op-amps can be used to add two or more signals, which is useful for creating circuits that perform mathematical operations.

**Conclusion**

Op-amps are versatile and powerful devices that can be used to perform a wide variety of operations. They are widely used in analog electronics, with applications in signal processing, control systems, and instrumentation. They are also used in many digital circuits, such as A/D converters and D/A converters.
